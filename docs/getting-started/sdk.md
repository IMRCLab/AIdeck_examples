Due to some changes made in the GAP8 SDK it's not easy to use a local installation of the official
SDK yet, so use our dockerized version instead. If you would like to understand the changes we've made,
have a look in the [aideck-docker repository](https://github.com/bitcraze/docker-aideck) and the
[GreenWaves SDK](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/gap_sdk).

To see a list of what SDK versions we have docker containers for have a look on [our Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitcraze/aideck/tags),
note that we only aim to keep the examples working with the latest tag.

For additional information on the SDK, have a look at the [GreenWaves GAP SDK documentation](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/gap_sdk).
